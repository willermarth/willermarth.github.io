    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <h3>What I do</h3>

    <p>I am a student at Dartmouth College majoring in Quantitative Social Science. I decided to take Web Mapping because it seemed like a good balance
    of STEM and Humanities. So far, I have loved the class!</p>

    <h3>Where I am from</h3>
    
    <p>I am from Etna, NH. I live less than 10 miles from where I go to college. I have a german shepard named Toby and I have recently gotten into fly fishing.</p>
